/* PRNG stc64.
 * Very fast PRNG suited for parallel usage with Weyl-sequence parameter.
 * 320-bit state, 256 bit is mutable.
 * Noticable faster than xoshiro and pcg, slighly slower than wyrand64 and
 * Romu, but these have restricted capacity for larger parallel jobs or unknown minimum periods.
 * stc64 supports 2^63 unique threads with a minimum 2^64 period lengths each.
 * Passes all statistical tests, e.g PractRand and correlation tests, i.e. interleaved
 * streams with one-bit diff state. Even the 16-bit version (LR=6, RS=5, LS=3) passes
 * PractRand to multiple TB input.
